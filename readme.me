Project:
Fun little personal project in light of the upcoming general elections for Cayman in May 2021. 
Looking at sample of registered voters list in Grand Cayman, what can be learned about the concentration of eligible voters in various areas?
Also, since the voters list shows the occupation of a voter, what can be learn about educations levels, income levels per voter district? 
Is it (atleast statistically speaking) homogenuous? Or (as one would expect) significant differences?
